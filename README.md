# RA-StopClassification

# Current phase- data mine and label.
This project attempts to extract stops and relevant information from raw GPS data about delivery trucks in a data mining phase and classify them as 'Delivery' or 'Maintenance(non-delivery)'. After fetaure extraction and labeling, an appropriate machine learning algorithm will be used to train a model that predicts the kind of stop.

This is a research project under Dr.Xia at SUNY Polytechnic, Utica.
