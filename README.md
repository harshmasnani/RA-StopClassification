# RA-StopClassification

# Current phase- Extract/transform/clean and label(algortihm done and tested, awaiting more data files from source), use logisitic regression and test(using dummy files)
This project attempts to extract stops and relevant information from raw GPS data about delivery trucks in a data mining phase and classify them as 'Delivery' or 'Maintenance(non-delivery)'. After feature extraction and labeling, an appropriate machine learning algorithm will be used to train a model that predicts the kind of stop.

This is a research project as part of Research Assistantship at SUNY Polytechnic, Utica.
