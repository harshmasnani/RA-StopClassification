# RA-StopClassification

This project attempts to extract stops from raw GPS data about delivery trucks and classify them as 'Delivery' or 
'Maintenance(non-delivery)' through a seroius data cleaning phase. After labeling, an appropriate machine learning algorithm 
will be used to train a model.

This is research project under Dr.Xia at SUNY Polytechnic, Utica. Collaborators are Computer and Information Science grad Students at SUNY Polytechnic.
