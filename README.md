# RA-StopClassification

# Current phase- Data minning & modelling completed(Stops extracted from raw geospatial data). Labelling stops as Delivery or Maintenance from reference file(groundtruth data that tracks deliveries) by writing an approximation algorithm.
This project attempts to extract stops and relevant information from raw GPS data about delivery trucks in a data mining phase and classify them as 'Delivery' or 'Maintenance(non-delivery)'. After feature extraction and labeling, an appropriate machine learning/deep learning algorithm will be used to train a model that predicts the kind of stop.

This is a research project as part of Research Assistantship at SUNY Polytechnic, Utica.
